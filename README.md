- 👋 Hi, I’m @anabellemolina
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking new recipes, traveling to new places around the world, reading as many books as I can and creating something of my own.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and SQL. Outside of coding, I like to learn more about Marketing, Philosophy, Graphic Design and Analytics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on website projects, business ideas, cooking recipes and writing novels!
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can reach out to me through LinkedIn! 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I almost got into a fist fight with a Kangaroo. It tried to fight me over my jumbo cup of treats. I now don't like Kangaroos.
